# Attention_Network_for_Deepfake_Detection
_This implementation borrows heavily from RECCE model._

### Introduction
This repository contains implementation of a model- _Attention Network for Deepfake Detection_. The input for the model is taken in the form of extracted images from vedios or simply images. The model is PyTorch based. The model achieves Accuracy of 98.12%  and AUC-ROC of  0.998 on Dataset - CelebDF(v2).
